# CRUD Node.js Application

## Description

This is a Node.js application that demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with a MongoDB database. 

## Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations
- Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose
- Environment variable configuration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

    ```plaintext
    CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-address>/<database>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
    ```

5. (Optional) Add other environment variables if needed.

### Running the Application

1. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. The server will run on `http://localhost:4000` by default.

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your MongoDB connection string is correct and that MongoDB is running.
- **Port Conflicts**: Make sure the port specified in your configuration is not in use by another application.

### Deployment

To deploy this application, follow the steps provided by your hosting service. Make sure to configure your environment variables in the deployment settings.
